Chrono Quest is a sci-fi educational adventure game where players travel between European airports across different timelines to collect Chrono Shards and restore the flow of time. It teaches strategy, logical thinking, and resource management using Python and MariaDB.

## Story

You are a time traveler whose time machine has shattered, scattering five Chrono Shards across history. Starting from a random European airport, you must explore different eras, manage limited credits and energy, and survive paradox traps to recover all shards.
Each airport may reward or punish you: find caches for credits, lose money in paradoxes, or discover shards. When you collect all shards and return to your starting point, time is restored.

## Gameplay

* Start by entering your name; a random European airport is assigned.
* View your current credits, range, and collected shards.
* Travel to airports by entering ICAO codes; each trip consumes resources.
* Random events occur at airports: cache, trap, shard, or nothing.
* Win by returning to your starting airport with all shards.
* Lose if you run out of energy or no airports remain in range.
